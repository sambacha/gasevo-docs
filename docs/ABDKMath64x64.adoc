[[-notice]]
=== ðŸ“‹ Notice

Smart contract library of mathematical functions operating with signed
64.64-bit fixed point numbers. Signed 64.64-bit fixed point number is
basically a simple fraction whose numerator is signed 128-bit integer
and denominator is 2^64. As long as denominator is always the same,
there is no need to store it, thus in Solidity signed 64.64-bit fixed
point numbers are represented by int128 type holding only the numerator.

The contract has been deployed to:

* *Network 4*: `0xB26aC0C1B506D88BA3bCf4298236ab8381808D15`
